# udacity-data-wrangling
This project was part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. For the assignment, I gathered data from three different sources, assessed the data, cleaned and transformed it as needed, and produced compelling visualizations. 

# Motivation
I graduated from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program in April 2020. As part of the program, I was tasked with completing a project that showcased my data wrangling skills - including gathering data from three different sources (.csv file, url, and API), assessing this data, cleaning and transforming it as needed, compiling compelling visualizations, and finally producing internal- and external-facing final outputs. 

# Data Sources
The first two datasources, a .csv file containing limited information about WeRateDogs Twitter archive and a url-accessible .tsv file with the results of an image prediction neural network program, were provided by Udacity. The final datasource used Twitter's API to access additional information about selected WeRateDogs tweets. 

# How to use
To access the project's final outputs, an internal .pdf ("wrangle_report") detailing my approach to data wrangling and an external .pdf ("act_report") displaying visualizations and communication insights learned from the data, view or download the .pdf files. To re-reun the project itself, there are two approaches: 
1. Apply for a Twitter developer account in order to access your Consumer API keys and Access Tokens. This information will need to be added to the .ipynb file before it can be run. Comment out cell #13. Download the 'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv' file in the /input folder.  
2. Comment out cells #6, 7 and 9. Download the 'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv', 'extra_info.csv' and 'errors.csv' files in the /input folder.
